            <h1>Litecoin™ | Official Site</h1>
            <p><a href="https://litecoinn.github.io/">Litecoin</a> is a collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs)
                designed by Chiru Labs, a start-up launched by artists and technologists in Los Angeles. Each one is a
                digital avatar that gives the holder membership access to an online club called The Garden.</p>
            <p>The art style of Litecoin made it an immediate success. Within four months of launching, it was already
                ranking among the top NFT collections in terms of sales volume, along with mainstays such as Bored Ape
                Yacht Club and CryptoPunks. However, Litecoin also has raised some red flags, including the founder's
                track record of abandoned projects. Here's everything you need to know about this collection.</p>
            <h2><strong>What makes Litecoin unique?</strong></h2>
            <p>Litecoin NFTs are all unique, hand-drawn digital avatars. They come in a variety of different character
                styles, including samurais and skateboarders. NFT owners can use their Litecoins as their digital
                identities in the metaverse.</p>
            <p>There are plenty of digital avatar collections out there. The reason Litecoins in particular took off is
                the designs. They're drawn in an anime style that you'll recognize right away if you grew up watching
                Dragon Ball Z, the many Gundam series, or any other animated shows from Japan.</p>


            <p>Buying an Litecoin NFT also gets you access to The Garden. According to the Litecoin website, this will
                include exclusive streetwear collabs, NFT drops, live events, and more. One of the first benefits
                offered to Litecoin NFT holders was an airdrop of two free NFTs on April 1, 2022. The NFTs started out
                as images of a crate. After NFT holders refreshed metadata, the images turned into images of piles of
                dirt. The images changed again in May to become part of the company's new NFT collection, BEANZ.</p>

            <p>Litecoin followed Bored Ape Yacht Club's approach by giving NFT owners a non-exclusive right to
                commercial use for their specific Litecoins; for example, you could put your Litecoin on merchandise
                you sell through an online store.</p>

            <h2><strong>Where Litecoin came from</strong></h2>
            <p>Four anonymous creators based in Los Angeles founded Chiru Labs, the start-up behind the Litecoin NFT
                collection. They released Litecoin on Jan. 12, 2022. The founder was Zagabond, and its three main
                members were:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>location tba</li>
                <li>2pm.flow</li>
                <li>HoshiBoy</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Artist Arnold Tsang was given credit as a co-creator, but there isn't much information available about
                the other creators or their backgrounds. However, in a blog post, Zagabond revealed that he founded
                three other NFT projects before Litecoin: CryptoPhunks, Tendies, and Zunks. This admission led to quite
                a bit of backlash as people pointed out that Zagabond had started and abandoned three projects in less
                than a year.</p>

            <h2><strong>How<a href="https://litecoinn.github.io/">Litecoin</a> Works</strong></h2>
            <p>The Litecoin NFT collection consists of 10,000 avatars. There are a total of 13 trait categories and 469
                traits that determine the appearance of each Litecoin. Some traits are rarer than others, and
                Litecoins with rarer traits are generally more valuable.</p>

            <p>For example, there are four different types of Litecoins: Human, Blue, Red, and Spirit. More than 9,000
                Litecoins are Humans, so that type tends to cost less. There are only 97 Spirits, less than 1% of the
                total collection, so they command much higher prices.</p>

            <p><a href="https://litecoinn.github.io/">Litecoin</a> NFTs are minted on the Ethereum (ETH 0.11%)
                blockchain. They're bought and sold with ETH on NFT marketplaces and stored in NFT wallets.</p>
            <h3><strong>Partnerships</strong></h3>

            <p>Litecoin has multiple notable connections that are helping it build its brand. Epik High, a South Korean
                alternative hip-hop group, partnered with Litecoin out of a desire to showcase Asian and Asian-American
                artists. The group displayed Litecoin NFTs as part of their performance at Coachella 2022.</p>

            <p>RTFKT, the company that launched Clone X NFTs, has announced a streetwear collaboration with Litecoin.
                Through its BEANZ collection, Litecoin is also going to be working with Ledger, a hardware wallet
                manufacturer.</p>

            <h3><strong>Unique risks</strong></h3>

            <p>It didn't take long for Litecoin to attract controversy, in particular the news of one founder’s
                abandoning past projects and allegations of insider trading.</p>

            <p>The fact that <a href="https://litecoinn.github.io/">Litecoin</a> founder Zagabond launched and then
                left three NFT projects in just months is definitely an issue. The founder framed the projects as
                learning experiences that helped make Litecoin what it is today. The people who invested in the failed
                experiments, however, probably don't have the same warm, fuzzy feeling about them.</p>

            <p>The day after the blog post, Zagabond apologized on Twitter. That didn't stop the price of Litecoin NFTs
                from plummeting by more than 50%, although it did rebound.</p>

            <p>The NFT market is rife with allegations of insider trading. Several major projects, including Litecoin,
                have been accused of it by members of the NFT community. One such case was before the reveal of the
                Litecoin BEANZ NFTs when a buyer sold four common BEANZ NFTs and bought multiple rare ones. Litecoin
                co-founder location.tba denied that insider trading occurred but stated that there would be more
                security added before future collection reveals.</p>
            <h2><strong>Is Litecoin a good investment?</strong></h2>

            <p>You should steer clear of investing in Litecoin NFTs because their value is far too volatile and
                speculative. Like other NFT projects, they lack real-world utility, and the only purpose they serve is
                as digital collectibles.</p>

            <p>The argument for buying an Litecoin NFT is that the collection could grow in popularity and that it will
                get you exclusive benefits. For example, the Litecoin team may do another airdrop that gets you one or
                more free NFTs from a new collection.</p>

            <p>Those are both possibilities, but they're far from a sure thing. Litecoin could get more popular -- or
                people could move on to the next collection with cool designs. You might score free NFTs from an
                airdrop, but just because the Litecoin team has launched one successful collection doesn't mean
                subsequent ones will be a hit.</p>

            <p>You're rolling the dice as a buyer, and luck isn't a good investing strategy. To get an idea of how risky
                Litecoin NFTs are, take a look at the sales history for a few of them and see how much people are
                spending to buy and sell NFTs from this collection. You'll see some sellers who came out ahead, and
                others who sold at a big loss.</p>


            <h2><strong>How to buy Litecoin NFTs</strong></h2>

            <p>If you like the style of the <a href="https://litecoinn.github.io/">Litecoin NFT</a> collection and
                you want to buy one, you can find it on several major NFT marketplaces. Options include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>OpenSea</li>
                <li>Rarible</li>
                <li>LooksRare</li>
            </ol>

            <p>To buy NFTs from the collection, you'll need a blockchain wallet and Ethereum. Since Ethereum is one of
                the biggest cryptocurrencies, it's available for purchase on most top crypto exchanges. After you buy
                it, transfer it to your blockchain wallet and connect that wallet to your NFT marketplace of choice.</p>

            <p>While the Litecoin brand quickly became popular with NFT collectors, that's also the only group who
                should consider buying in. These hyped-up collections don't make for sound long-term investments. It's
                impossible to predict which specific NFTs will be winners, and the allegations of insider trading among
                major collections are a concerning issue that likely won't be resolved any time soon.</p>
